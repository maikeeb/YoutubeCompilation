1. get clips/videos off twitch  ----- done
2. concatenate twitch clips into one mp4 --- done

notes:
want more transformative content done by edits
    first edit going to be transitions, intro, outro

uploading to youtube:
    open browser, login to youtube account
    upload to youtube?
    upload into private to cut out music before uploading
    wait until 'upload complete' is there to then exit browser



titling videos:
    avoid using #1
    clickbait the first couple of vids in the title
        need to learn more about clickbait in titles
    have something the same in each video title (ie. "made by a bot")

        a video made by a bot about xxxxx
        video of xxxxx made by a bot
        a bot made video of xxxxx
        this video of xxxxx is made by a bot
        xxxxx video made by a bot
